# PyRootFS

This project aims to provide a library to handle rootfs management operations:

* create an empty rootfs directory;
* inspect a rootfs dir;
* compare and diff two different rootfs dirs;
* snapshot a rootfs into a tarball archive.

A `pyrootfs` cli is provided for convenience to demonstrate
the usage of said API.
